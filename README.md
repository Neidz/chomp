# Chomp

Welcome to Chomp, application for tracking calories, fats, proteins, carbohydrates and weight. I'm using it daily, so it's ready for use and will be stable but I'm still adding new features and there are still things that I want to improve, so expect noticable changes.

### Installation
Currently the app was tested only on linux and installing it on linux is as simple as cloning the repo running

```
script/install-linux.sh
```

on other platforms you are on your own
