# Chomp

Welcome to Chomp, application for tracking calories, fats, proteins and carbohydrates. I'm using it daily, so it's ready for use and will be stable but it's still in development.

### Installation
Currently the app was tested only on linux and installing it on linux is as simple as running

```
script/install-linux.sh
```

on other platforms you are on your own
